The ocean surface temperature increased from 19°C to 20.47°C, and the bottom atmospheric layer warmed from 15°C to 15.93°C. This departure from equilibrium occurs because the original heat transfer coefficients were tuned for 100% ocean coverage. The addition of land (with much lower heat capacity due to shallow depth) disrupts the energy balance, requiring re-tuning of the heat transfer parameters."

The key to restoring equilibrium was increasing vertical heat transfer within the ocean (ocn_heat_transfer), which more efficiently transports heat from the warm surface layers to cooler deep layers. This prevents excessive heat accumulation at the surface while maintaining realistic deep ocean temperatures. The land-ocean split requires stronger vertical ocean mixing to compensate for the reduced overall heat capacity of the surface."

        "# Key Insights:\n",
        "The ocean surface mixing coefficient is by far the most important parameter, with approximately 3-5× greater impact than atmosphere mixing and 5× greater impact than the interface coupling. This reflects the ocean's dominant role as Earth's primary heat reservoir. The ocean's large heat capacity means that even small changes in vertical mixing rates dramatically affect how much solar energy accumulates at the surface versus being stored in deeper layers. Land temperatures show the largest absolute changes because the shallow equivalent water depth (8.4m) provides minimal thermal inertia compared to the deep ocean (3150m).\n",
        "Long-term Behavior:\n",
        "All simulations showed continued warming over 100 years, indicating that the coefficients tuned for 15-year equilibrium are not stable over centennial timescales. This suggests the model would require different parameter values for long-term climate projections."
