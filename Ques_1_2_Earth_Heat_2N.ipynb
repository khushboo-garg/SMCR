        "Radiative Transfer (in atmosphere): The code correctly implements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Stefan-Boltzmann radiation: R ∝ T⁴\n",
        "2. Layer emissivity (ε_atm = 0.78) for greenhouse effect\n",
        "3. Transmission and absorption: each layer absorbs a fraction (ε_atm) and transmits the remainder (1-ε_atm)\n",

        "Several processes are absent or simplified:\n",

        "1. Latent heat transport: No evaporation/condensation cycle (water vapor transport is a major heat redistribution mechanism)\n",
        "2. Horizontal heat transport: The model is 1D (vertical only); no meridional or zonal heat transport\n",
        "3. Cloud effects: No cloud radiative forcing (clouds significantly affect both shortwave and longwave radiation)\n",
        "4. Shortwave absorption in atmosphere: Solar radiation goes directly to surface; no atmospheric absorption of incoming sunlight\n",
        "5. Wind-driven mixing: Heat transfer coefficients are constant, not dependent on wind speed or stability\n",

        "(d) Assumptions Implied by the Code:\n",

        "1. One-dimensional (vertical only): Earth is treated as a single column with no horizontal variation - essentially modeling a globally-averaged climate\n",
        "2. Constant layer properties: Each layer has uniform properties throughout its thickness\n",
        "3. Gray atmosphere: Atmospheric emissivity is constant across all wavelengths (real atmosphere has wavelength-dependent absorption)\n",
        "4. No phase changes: Water remains liquid/vapor without explicit modeling of condensation or freezing\n",
        "5. Steady solar input: Solar constant is fixed (no diurnal or seasonal cycles)\n",
        "6. Constant albedo: Surface reflectivity (α = 0.35) doesn't vary with ice cover, vegetation, or clouds\n",
        "7. Exponential density profile: Atmospheric density follows a simple exponential decay with altitude\n",
        "8. Fixed stratosphere temperature: Top boundary condition assumes constant stratospheric temperature (213 K)\n",
        "9. Simple mixing parameterization: Heat transfer coefficients are prescribed constants rather than calculated from turbulence theory\n",
        "10. No land-ocean distinction: The original code treats the entire surface as ocean (this was addressed in Question 3)\n",
        "11. Radiative equilibrium in ocean: Ocean uses only conduction/convection, no internal radiative transfer\n",
        "12. Time-invariant parameters: All physical constants remain fixed throughout the simulation\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these simplifications, the model captures the essential physics of vertical energy balance and provides useful insights into climate sensitivity to parameters like greenhouse gas concentrations (through emissivity) and mixing rates.\n"
